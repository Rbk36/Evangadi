Advanced JavaScript Algorithms - practice exercise
Question 1 Given an array of numbers, write a function that prints in the console another array
which contains all the even numbers in the original array, which also have even indexes only.
○ Test 1: getOnlyEvens([1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8]) prints [ 4]
○ Test 2: getOnlyEvens([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) prints [0, 2, 4]
Question 2
● Create a function that takes a two-digit number as an parameter and prints "Ok" in
the console if the given string is greater than its reversed digit version. If not, the
function will print "Not ok"
○ Test 1: reverseCompare(72) prints "ok" because 72 > 27
○ reverseCompare(23) prints "Not ok", because 23 is not greater than 32
Question 3
● Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the factorial of the number.
Notes: The factorial of 0 is 1. Ex: factorial seven is : 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7. The
factorial of any positive integer x is x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) * . . . . . . * 1 (ex: factorial of 4 is
4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24)
○ Test 1: returnFactorial(5) outputs 120
○ Test 2: returnFactorial(6) outputs 720
○ Test 3: returnFactorial(0) outputs 1
Question 4 (Meera array)
● A Meera array is defined to be an array containing only numbers as its elements and for
all n values in the array, the value n*2 is not in the array. So [3, 5, -2] is a Meera array
because 3*2, 5*2 or 2*2 are not in the array. But [8, 3, 4] is not a Meera array because
2*4=8 and both 4 and 8 are elements found in the array. Write a function that takes an
array of numbered elements and prints “I am a Meera array” in the console if its array
does NOT contain n and also n*2 as value. Otherwise, the function prints “I am NOT a
Meera array”
○ Test 1: checkMeera([10, 4, 0, 5]) outputs “I am NOT a Meera array” because 5 *
2 is 10
○ Test 2: checkMeera([7, 4, 9]) outputs “I am a Meera array”
○ Test 1: checkMeera([1, -6, 4, -3]) outputs “I am NOT a Meera array” because -3
*2 is -6
Question 5 (Dual array)
● Define a Dual array to be an array where every value occurs exactly twice. For example,
{1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2} is a dual array.The following arrays are not Dual arrays {2, 5, 2, 5, 5} (5
occurs three times instead of two times) {3, 1, 1, 2, 2} (3 occurs once instead of two
times) Write a function named isDual that returns 1 if its array argument is a Dual array.
Otherwise it returns 0.
Question 6
● Write a function that takes the number of seconds and returns the digital format clock
time as a string. Time should be counted from 00:00:00.
○ Examples: digitalClock(5025) as "01:23:45" 5025 seconds is 1 hour, 23 mins, 45
secs.
■ digitalClock(61201) as "17:00:01" No AM/PM. 24h format.
■ digitalClock(87000) as "00:10:00" It's 00:10 next day.
